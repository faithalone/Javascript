# Javascript and DOM Manipulation

This Javascript code will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset and will also allow users to filter the table data for specific values. The other coding languages used are HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on the web pages. 

The first part of the code is to create an Automatic Table and Date Search. Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, this code will append a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting. Then using a date form in your HTML document, the JavaScript code will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

The second part of the code is to create Multiple Search Categories using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns. The JavaScript code written will allow the user to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
